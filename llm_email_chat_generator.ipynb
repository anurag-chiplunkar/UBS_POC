Unfortunately, I have yet to receive a resolution or a satisfactory explanation for the missing funds. My account number is 1234567890, and I have attached a copy of the statement in question for your reference. As you can see from the attachment, there is a transaction dated 02/15/2023 for $500.00 that I did not authorize. I have tried to contact the bank's customer service multiple times, but the issue remains unresolved. I would greatly appreciate it if you could look into this matter urgently and provide me with a detailed explanation of the transaction and the steps being taken to rectify the situation. Please find the attachment: Account_Statement_1234567890.pdf My previous email was dated 02/20/2023, with the subject 'Discrepancy in Account Statement'.

I checked my account online and saw that I was charged $35 for overdraft on 3 separate transactions. I understand that I went below the minimum balance, but I had set up overdraft protection from my savings account. I've attached a screenshot of my account activity for your reference. Could you please look into this and refund the fees? I've been a customer for over 5 years and have never had this issue before. My previous email about this issue was on 03/10/2023, but I haven't received a response yet. Please let me know if there's any additional information you need from me. Thanks, David Kim\"}\n"

I need to know, like, when I can expect to be able to log in again, you know? I'm available, like, all day, so, yeah, just give me a call back whenever, okay? Thanks, yeah, I really appreciate it. Oh, and, um, one more thing, can you, like, also look into, uh, my credit card account, too? I think there might be, like, a problem with that as well, yeah.
